# hello-world
My first repository
Greetings - I'm a novice to all of this, but anxious to learn.  My background is 40 years in the investment field, everything from senior level positions managing large hedge fund capital pools including the use of various derivatives and leveraged products, to plain vanilla index fund management and everything inbetween.  I'm particularly interested in using GitHub to leverage new approaches to investment management.  "Algo trading" is no longer a viable option for me in retirement, not enough tools and insurmountable latency problems.  More focused on innovative approaches to investing, particularly using listed options as leverage/risk levers to construct max/min investment scenarios with defined risk and the potential for leveraged reward.
